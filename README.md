# ‚ùóÔ∏èExecuting the code locally
## Executing the back-end
You need to have Java and Maven installed and configured locally.

Open the crud-spring project in your favorite IDE as a Maven project and execute it as Spring Boot application.

## Executing the front-end
You need to have Node.js / NPM installed locally.

 1. Install all the required dependencies:

        npm install

2. Execute the project:

        npm run start
        
This command will run the Angular project with a proxy to the Java server, without requiring CORS.

Open your browser and access http://localhost:4200 (Angular default port).
